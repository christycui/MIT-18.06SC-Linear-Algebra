%=======================02-713 LaTeX template, following the 15-210 template==================
%
% You don't need to use LaTeX or this template, but you must turn your homework in as
% a typeset PDF somehow.
%
% How to use:
%    1. Update your information in section "A" below
%    2. Write your answers in section "B" below. Precede answers for all 
%       parts of a question with the command "\question{n}{desc}" where n is
%       the question number and "desc" is a short, one-line description of 
%       the problem. There is no need to restate the problem.
%    3. If a question has multiple parts, precede the answer to part x with the
%       command "\part{x}".
%    4. If a problem asks you to design an algorithm, use the commands
%       \algorithm, \correctness, \runtime to precede your discussion of the 
%       description of the algorithm, its correctness, and its running time, respectively.
%    5. You can include graphics by using the command \includegraphics{FILENAME}

% no need to restate the problem --- the graders know which problem is which,
% but replacing "The First Problem" with a short phrase will help you remember
% which problem this is when you read over your homeworks to study.

\question{10.1}{}
\part{a} If there are right hand sides \(b\) for which \(Ax = b\) has no solutions, it means that there are right hand sides for which combinations of the columns of \(A\) can't represent. If so, the rank \(r\) is smaller than the number of rows \(m\).

\part{b} The solutions to \(A^Ty = 0\) are the left nullspace of \(A\) whose dimension is \(m - r\). Since from part (a) we concluded that \(r < m\), it leads to \(m - r > 0\) so there are always solutions.

\question{10.2}{}
\(A^Ty = d\) is solvable when \(d\) is in row space of \(A\). The solution \(y\) is unique when the left nullspace of \(A\) contains only the zero vector.
